The site has been offline for a while, due to multiple factors - mainly lack of time. Also, my previous hosting service was straight up unusable, but that is taken care of. Hopefully I will be able to rebuild to a much simpler site, without WordPress and such. (Ain't nobody got time for maintaining / securing that junk...) <!--more-->So back to HTML and learning Jekyll, so there will be a lot of cosmetic try-n-error but hopefully who cares, because the content will not be affected.  
Help is always appreciated, reach out if you are bored and have time on your hand to donate. I have the site on my Github.
